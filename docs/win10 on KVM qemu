========================================
Extracting your Windows license key
Prior to Windows 8, the Windows license key could be found on a sticker on the back or bottom of a computer. 
Now, the license key is rather unhelpfully embedded inside the computer. Perhaps more unhelpfully, 
there is no option to view the key in the BIOS on most computers, 
including the Lenovo ThinkPad W550s used for this article. As such, 
the key must be manually extracted from the ACPI table in which it is stored. 
Fortunately, there is an open source tool to do so.

In order to do this, the acpica-tools package must be installed via the command line. 
On Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and SUSE, this is:

sudo dnf install acpica-tools
Alternatively, for Debian and Ubuntu users:

sudo apt-get install acpica-tools
With this installed, the acpidump command can be used to view the entire table. D
umping the contents of all ACPI tables would produce a lot of extraneous data, so to select only the license key, 
use the following command:

sudo acpidump -n MSDM
This will return data that looks like this:

MSDM @ 0x0000000000000000
  0000: 4D 53 44 4D 55 00 00 00 03 B1 4C 45 4E 4F 56 4F  MSDMU.....LENOVO

  0050: 32 42 37 51 38                                   2B7Q8
The five sets of five characters separated by dashes at the end is the license key. In this example, this is FCKGW-RHQQ2-YXRKT-8TG6W-2B7Q8.

Selecting a virtual machine and installing Windows
In Linux, using KVM/QEMU is the most pain-free virtualization option, as it is built into the kernel and there are no kernel extensions to configure. 
The Boxes app provides a very easy to use GUI for this (and is installed by default on Fedora), though if you need extensive configuration options, 
virt-manager is intended for power users. For cases like this, where Windows 10 is a guest on a Linux machine, the VirtIO package is needed 
for networking and disk device drivers. They can be downloaded from here. 
Likewise, SPICE is used for 3D acceleration, clipboard sharing, USB device sharing, and other functions. The SPICE guest tools package can be downloaded here.
